# Welcome to Build my World :boom:

The goal of this first project was to **create a world and two instances of a robot in it** using Gazebo.

Being the very first project, the learning curve in this project is exponential, you are not required to know git command but if you do it will be good for you. **Make sure to make the world as easy as possible** :ok_hand:

A short demo [videoclip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bB7KnZmxT4) (of a success case): can be found on my youtube Channel
