# Welcome to Build my World :boom:

The goal of this first project was to **create a world and two instances of a robot in it** using Gazebo.

Being the very first project, the learning curve in this project is exponential, you are not required to know git command but if you do it will be good for you. **Make sure to make the world as easy as possible** :ok_hand:

## Summary Tasks
* Build a single floor wall structure using the Building Editor tool in Gazebo. Applied at least one feature, one color, and one texture to my structure. Makking sure there's enough space between the walls for a robot to navigate.
* Modelled an object using the Model Editor tool in Gazebo. Model links are connected with joints.
* Imported the structure and two instances of the model inside an empty Gazebo World.
* Imported at least one model from the Gazebo online library and implement it in your existing Gazebo world.
* Wrote a C++ World Plugin to interact with the world. the code displays “Welcome to ’s World!” message as soon as I launch the Gazebo world file.
## Folder Files
* model folder:
  - Any object or robot designed in the Model Editor tool of Gazebo
  - A single floor structure designed in the Building Editor tool of Gazebo
* world folder:

* script folder:
