# Welcome to Go Chase it :robot:

The goal of this first project was to **create a robot model, launch it inside the world created in the prevoius project and develop a c++ node to find white ball**.

This project is harder that the first one, a lot of support is given from udacity lectures and you will learn how to create a c++, Publishers and subscribers and making a connection between them.

A short demo [videoclip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m-EOrbj6sM) (of a success case): can be found on my youtube Channel :boom:
